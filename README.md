# A pulmonologist’s guide to perform and analyse cross-species single-lung-cell transcriptomics 

Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) is becoming widely employed to study biological processes in great depth. Its name describes its key advantage, the resolution of transcriptomes at single-cell level.
In the Publication mentioned above, we exemplarily demonstrate integration and qualitative assessment of scRNA-Seq-data across three species: human (Homo sapiens), hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and mice (Mus musculus). We used quality-filtered scRNA-seq data of lungs from 4 different sources (Figure 1) using up to date analysis workflows.
All cross-species analysis code of this example including expression of canonical celltype-specific genes is made available via this Github page. For the creation of Figure 1 further processing and alignment was performed with Inkscape (Inkscape Community; https://inkscape.org/de/; gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape)

B) Pie charts of lung cell frequencies in indicated species. C) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of identified cell populations across species. D) Feature plots indicating the stress response of single lung cells across species based on the 14 stress related genes ATF3, BTG1, BTG2, DUSP1, EGR1, FOS, FOSB, HSP90AB1, HSPA8, HSPB1, IER3, JUN, JUNB, and JUND. Prolif.: proliferating, AT1: alveolar epithelial cells type 1, AT2: alveolar epithelial cells type 2, ly Endothelial: lymphatic endothelial cells.

FIGURE S1: 
Dotplot of cross-species comparison of RNA marker genes. The point size indicates the percentage of cells in a certain population expressing the indicated marker gene. The colour indicates the dataset. Hamster: red, Mouse: blue, Human Charité: green, Human Travaglini et al.: black. Average expression is indicated by colour intensity.
