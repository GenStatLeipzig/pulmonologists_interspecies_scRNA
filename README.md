# A pulmonologist’s guide to perform and analyse cross-species single-lung-cell transcriptomics 

In the Publication mentioned above, we exemplarily demonstrate integration and qualitative assessment of scRNA-Seq-data across three species: human (Homo sapiens), hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and mice (Mus musculus). We used quality-filtered scRNA-seq data of lungs from 4 different sources (Figure 1) using up to date analysis workflows.
